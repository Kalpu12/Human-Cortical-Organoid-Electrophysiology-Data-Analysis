# Human-Cortical-Organoid-Electrophysiology-Data-Analysis
this repository contains the excel spreadsheeet and python notebooks that I used for data analysis of movement across different regions of the brain.  
# Old Organoid Python Notebook 
this includes the python script wrriten for old organoid data processing, box-plot figure generation, p-value comparisons for cell count and velocity movement across differnt regions of the cortical organoids based on experimental conditions. 
# Young Organoid Python Notebook 
this includes the python script written young data processing, box-plot figure generation, p-value comparisons for cell count and velocity movement across differnt regions of the cortical organoids based on experimental conditions 
# Excel Spreadsheets 
Contains the raw data for cell count and velocity ( y2-y1/x2-x1)  across different regions and experimental conditions for cortical organoids.
